          Good point. I really didn't. There were people who directly and indirectly helped in making them.
          Because of this <strong>Thanks go to:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/madprime">Madeleine Price Ball</a></strong>, Executive
          Director of Open Humans, helped with implementing the file-upload code that pushes the uploaded
          data to Open Humans.

          Much of the map-based JavaScript stuff that is implemented here are remnants of
            a great workshop that <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/leejoeyk">Joey Lee</a></strong> gave
            at <em>Mozfest 2016</em>!

        <p>
          I'm pretty sure that I missed something cool that could be done with <em>Twitter Archives</em>.
          You can always let me know what I missed. But even better: This whole thing is <a href="https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser/">open source</a>. So you can
          <a href="https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser/issues">open an issue on GitHub</a> (thanks for that) or even directly <a href="https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/twitter-analyser/pulls">contribute a pull request</a> that adds the data
          visualization that you're missing!
        </p>
        <p>
          Even better: If you have a great idea that would substantially extend the <font color="#1DA1F2">Tw</font>ArÏ‡iv
          you can even be paid for doing so:
          <strong><a href="https://www.openhumans.org/grants/">Open Humans offers grants of $5,000 for the creation of projects.</a></strong>
