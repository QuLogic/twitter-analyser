          The amount we tweet per day can change over time. This data can be
          really noisy: On some days we might hammer out one tweet after the other,
          while on other days we don't get around to doing much tweeting at all.
          There might be vacations, days where you're sick in bed etc. This can make
          it very hard to see long-term trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason the data here was
          averaged to remove the noise. This was done by applying a rolling average
          on a 180 day window. This should make it much easier to see how one's
          behaviour changed over larger time-frames (In <code>pandas</code> this
          rolling average is created by
          <code>
            dataframe.rolling('180d').mean()
          </code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          In our graph to the left the <code>x-axis</code> gives us the time since
          one signed up for <i>Twitter</i> and the <code>y-axis</code> gives the
          normalized number of tweets on a given day.

        <p>
          There are different types of tweets one can send on Twitter. Some tweets
          are <code>replies</code> to tweets by other users, while other tweets are
          <code>retweets</code> of tweets done by other users.
          Last, but not least there are the good old <code>regular tweets</code>,
          which are neither a reply to anyone nor a retweet of tweet.

          And of course 

          really noisy: On some days we might hammer out one tweet after the other,
          while on other days we don't get around to doing much tweeting at all.
          There might be vacations, days where you're sick in bed etc. This can make
          it very hard to see long-term trends.

          Again, this data might be very noisy due to short-time changes.
          For this reason the data here was averaged to remove the noise.
          This was done by applying a rolling average on a 180 day window.
          This should make it much easier to see how one's
          behaviour changed over larger time-frames (In <code>pandas</code> this
          rolling average is created by

        <p>
          In our graph to the left the <code>x-axis</code> gives us the time since
          one signed up for <i>Twitter</i> and the <code>y-axis</code> gives the
          percentage that different tweet types account for on the overall tweet volume.
